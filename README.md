# stream-elements
Stream Elements is a polyfill for streaming-elements which do not exist always.

## Implementation
This offers some ESModules that you can load and apply on HTMLElement based elements to add streams to the property based event callbacks.
Also adds readableFromString helper util method to work with SerializedWriteStream([readable,readable]).pipeTo()
